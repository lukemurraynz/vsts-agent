# Output Variables

## Overview

The feature is to allow a given task to publish a set of variables back to server, so the variables can be used in downstream jobs. All output variables from the same task instance has its own namespace, so they don’t overlap each other within the job.

## Changes for task author and ad-hoc script owner

There will be 2 different ways to produce output variables.

### For task author:

Declare a new section in the task.json to indicate which variable will get published.
```	JSON
"OutputVariables": [{
    "name" : "MY_OUTPUTVARIABLE_1",
    "description" : "This is the description of my output variable."
}, 
{
    "name" : "MY_OUTPUTVARIABLE_2",
    "description" : "Description can contains markdown [vsts-tasks](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-tasks)"
}]
```
Task author doesn't have to change their task script if the script already use `##vso[task.setvariable]` to set variable.

Agent will base on the `OutputVariables` section from task.json determine which variable needs to publish, and patch timeline record with the output variables.

The `OutputVariables` section will also be used as intellisence hint in the definition editor.

### For Ad-hoc script:

Use `##vso` command to publish output variables. We will add a new parameter `isOutput=true/false` to the set variable command for setting output variable.

```
##vso[task.setvariable variable=foo;isSecret=false;isOutput=true;]value
```

In definition editor, downstream task won't get variable name intellisense for output variable that published by ad-hoc script.

## Server side changes:

The output variables will be stored as part of timeline record for each task instance, just like task issues. In this way, we can distinguish the same output variable published by 2 instances of same task within a job. Ex, the definition has 2 `AcquireToken` tasks which publish a output variable call `AuthToken`.

We will also introduce `ref name` to each task instance and each job, the `ref name` will be used as namespace for the output variable, so the downstream task can use the `ref name` to pick the right variable. 

```
Example: 
$(JobBuild1.XCode1.Variable1) in downstream job. 
$(XCode1.Variable1) in downstream task within the same job. 
```

### Ref name

A new `ref name` will be generate when a new task is added to the definition.

The generated `ref name` looks like this:
```
{TaskName}_{Number}
```

Customer can change it, but we will give a warning about they need change all downstream references. 

### TODO 

I am not sure how are we going to generate Job ref name, since we don’t have job chaining at this point. 

It should be something like:
```
{DefinitionName}_{JobName}
```

### Definition editor intellisense

We need add intellisense for typing variables in definition editor, since all output variables are defined in task.json.

## Agent changes

Today, the timeline record update is best effort on each update call, and continue retry on failure till the end of the job. When job finish, any remained error won’t affect the job result. 

We need change this since output variable is critical to downstream task/job, we don’t want a downstream job to fail because of some missing output variable, the failure will be expensive on big fanin fanout scenario. 

We should fail the job if it fails to produce output variable when job finish.

## Compat

Since task author needs to change their task.json in order to use the output variable feature, we suggest they should bump the major version in this case. since definition has major version locking, all existing definition should continue work without any problem. 

When definition owner decides to consume the new major version, they will fix the downstream task’s input to use the right name of the output variables anyway. because of this, we should not have any compat problem to worry about.

## Examples

1. Consume output variables Within same job
```
    Job_1
    |
    |__TaskA_1
    |
    |__TaskA_2
    |
    |__TaskB_1
    |
    |__TaskB_2
```

- `TaskA_1` and `TaskA_2` are two instances of same task `TaskA`.
- `TaskA` will base on its inputs to acquire a token from some service and produce an output variable `AuthToken`. 
- `TaskA_1`, `TaskA_2` are also the ref name for the task.

- `TaskB_1` and `TaskB_2` are two instances of same task `TaskB`.
- `TaskB` take credential as input and make a rest call to some endpoint.
- `TaskB_1`, `TaskB_2` are also the ref name for the task.

When consume an output variable in `TaskB_1` and `TaskB_2`, you must provide the `ref name` as namespace. Agent won’t set `$(AuthToken)` as long as `$(AuthToken)` is output variable. 

```
In the above example:
    TaskB_1’s input will be $(TaskA_1.AuthToken).
    TaskB_2’s input will be $(TaskA_2.AuthToken). 
```

2. Consume output variables in downstream job
```
    Job_1                       Job_2
    |                           |
    |__TaskA_1                  |__TaskB_1
    |                           |
    |__TaskA_2                  |__TaskB_2
```

- Same `TaskA` and `TaskB`, but this time `TaskB_1` and `TaskB_2` are in downstream job. 
```
In this example:
TaskB_1’s input will be $(Job_1.TaskA_1.AuthToken).
TaskB_2’s input will be $(Job_1.TaskA_2.AuthToken). 
```
